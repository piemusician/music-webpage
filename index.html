      <h1>My Interest In Music</h1>
      <h3> Music can be enjoyed in <span style="border: 1px solid black">multiple</span> ways</h3>
              <p>
                This is my webpage that shows my interest 
                in music. <br>I have been involved with music
                as a musician and I enjoy <br>watching musicals,
                listening to music on my free time, <br>and I
                enjoy dancing to music as a cheerleader.
